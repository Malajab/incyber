description: Clear command history in linux which is used for defense evasion.
    # Example config for this one (place it in .bash_profile):
    # (is_empty=false; inotifywait -m .bash_history | while read file; do if [ $(wc -l <.bash_history) -lt 1  ]; then if  [ "$is_empty" = false ]; then logger -i -p local5.info -t empty_bash_history "$USER : ~/.bash_history is empty "; is_empty=true; fi; else is_empty=false;  fi;  done ) &
    # It monitors the size of .bash_history and log the words "empty_bash_history" whenever a previously not empty bash_history becomes empty
    # We define an empty file as a document with 0 or 1 lines (it can be a line with only one space character for example)
    # It has two advantages over the version suggested by Patrick Bareiss  :
    #   - it is not relative to the exact command used to clear .bash_history : for instance Caldera uses "> .bash_history" to clear the history and this is not one the commands listed here. We can't be exhaustive for all the possibilities !
    #   - the method suggested by Patrick Bareiss logs all the commands entered directly in a bash shell. therefore it may miss some events (for instance it doesn't log the commands launched from a Caldera agent). Here if .bash_history is cleared, it will always be detected
